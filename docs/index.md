# Soma - Quantum Drug Discovery

**Accelerating molecular discovery through quantum machine learning**

## Our Mission

Soma harnesses the power of quantum computing and machine learning to revolutionize drug discovery. We develop cutting-edge quantum algorithms that can model molecular interactions with unprecedented accuracy, dramatically reducing the time and cost of bringing life-saving medicines to market.

## What We Do

- **Quantum ML Models**: Design hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for molecular property prediction
- **Drug Discovery Pipeline**: Build end-to-end platforms for pharmaceutical research
- **Research & Development**: Push the boundaries of quantum computing applications in chemistry

## Why Quantum?

Traditional computational methods struggle with the exponential complexity of molecular systems. Quantum computers naturally represent quantum mechanical systems, offering a fundamental advantage for:

- Molecular simulation and modeling
- Chemical reaction pathway optimization
- Drug-target interaction prediction
- Novel compound discovery

## Technology Stack

- **Quantum Frameworks**: PennyLane, Qiskit, Cirq
- **Classical ML**: PyTorch, JAX, scikit-learn
- **Chemistry**: RDKit, OpenMM, molecular databases
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-native, scalable quantum-classical hybrid systems
