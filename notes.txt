protien modeling, etc 

state space melds...


Soma is now a start up. We are going to use AI agents (locally at first, but larger models on the cloud later.)

We are a company that uses the most cutting edge technology (quantum computing, quantum machine learning, Agentic AI)
to run and buiilod this company, and to search for novel drugs, both small and large molecules.

First, we need to build a CEO agent that answers to me, Shawn, I am the founder, presiddent, and CEO. The CEO agent will answer to me as we mkae progress on this endeaver.

All agent code will be held within agents/ and all agent_config files are in config/

For prototyping, we will start with an ollama agent run locally on this machine and then we will scale up.

how should we begin?
